# TicTacToe
This project was my final project for CSC-440: Programming Languages. In this project, each student chose a programming language that they had never worked with before, 
wrote a report and designed a presentation around it, and finally a working application using that language. My project, made in Kotlin, is a Gradle application of TicTacToe,
complete with working logic and UI, made using the Android Library present in Kotlin.
